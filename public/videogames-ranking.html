<h1>The Best Videogames According to BeeGee</h1>
<h2>My top 3 videogames of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</h3>
<p>Skyrim is a classic. Even after all these years, the visuals still impress me.
The world is massive, atmospheric, and immersive. For a game released in 2011,
it was way ahead of its time and still holds up today.

<h3>Phasmophobia</h3>
<p>I’m a big fan of horror games, and Phasmophobia hits the sweet spot with its mix of jump scares and puzzle-solving. Investigating haunted locations with friends keeps things tense and fun, and no two games ever feel the same.</p>
<h3>Super Mega Baseball 4</h3>
<p>As a baseball fan, I love this one. It’s got solid gameplay and surprisingly deep mechanics, but what really makes it stand out are the hilarious and over-the-top player names. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, which makes it a blast to play.</p>
