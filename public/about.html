<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Bern. I’m a licensed Nutritionist-Dietitian who’s now making the shift into the world of IT and software. 
While I’m no longer practicing in healthcare, my background taught me how to think critically, work with people, 
and solve problems all of which I’m now bringing into tech.</p>

<p>I recently completed the IT Fundamentals course on Udemy and am currently working through Angela Yu’s Complete 
Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp to build my skills in web development. I’m excited about this new path and looking
forward to combining technical knowledge with real-world problem solving as I grow in the field.</p>

<p>Outside of work and learning, I play videogames, watch movies and tv shows, and listen to music (mostly Mariah Carey songs).
I also follow Major League Baseball and root for the Los Angeles Dodgers.
Right now, I’m focused on learning and building projects, and I’m open to opportunities where I can keep growing in IT or web development.
